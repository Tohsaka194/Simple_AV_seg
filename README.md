# Artery-Vein Segmentation (Unofficial Implementation)

This repository provides an unofficial implementation for artery-vein segmentation ([HiPaS](https://github.com/Arturia-Pendragon-Iris/HiPaS_AV_Segmentation)).  

You can run **`prediction.py`** to perform artery-vein segmentation.  
All checkpoints can be downloaded from the following link: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17073997).  

Alternatively, you can run **`prediction.CARVE.py`**, which uses our model trained on the **CARVE** dataset for intra-pulmonary artery-vein segmentation.
